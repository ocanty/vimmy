1.1 • The Virtual Machine
===================

The Vimmy Virtual Machine (**vimmyVM**) consists of 3 components, the **processor** and two hardware peripherals, the **Graphics Processing Unit (GPU)** and the **Keyboard**. The code you write will be ran on the processor, and you may optionally interface with the two supplied hardware devices to create visuals or allow input. Your main interface to accessing the virtual machine is the [Sandbox](/create/sandbox).

The processor runs code known as "assembly" or "assembler" language, this is a general term for a wide range of assembly languages. An assembly language consists of an **instruction set** that is supported by the processor, each instruction in the set can perform a specific operation when executed by the processor. These instructions can also take optional data known as **operands** which may be used by that type of instruction to do a specific action. The job of the assembler is to convert your code into binary data which can be loaded into memory and executed by the processor


The processor has a number of important features you need to be aware about.
Data in the processor can only be modified by an instruction when it is in a **register**.
The VM has 8 registers, 4 of which you are allowed to do with as you please. A register can store any 16-bit value, which means it can be in the range **(0 - 65535)** or **(–32,768 to 32,767)**


A, B, C, D - **General Purpose Registers**

*Stores any 16-bit value*

PC			- **Program Counter** 

*Stores the location of the current instruction in memory*

SP			- **Stack Pointer** 

*Stores the location of the top of the stack, you will learn more about this later*

BP			- **Base Pointer** 

*Stores the location of the bottom of the current stack frame, you will learn more about this later*

FL			- **Flags** 

*Stores state information about the CPU and the results of a previously executed instruction*

The VM has 0x10000 or 65535 bytes of RAM addressed from 0 to 0xFFFF. As time goes on it is important you become familiar with [hexadecimal notation](http://wiki.osdev.org/Hexadecimal_Notation). Certain memory locations are reserved for certain purposes and it is advised to write your own data in a location you are sure will not be modified

Debugging Tools

![VM](/img/lesson-resource/sandbox-vm.png)

There exists a number of debugging tools for you to use, these are: 
a full register preview, disassembly of the current executing code, a memory browser and a stack preview are given. You also have the main interface of the VM of course, which includes a keyboard and the screen.

The register preview shows the signed form, the unsigned form and the hex form of the number
