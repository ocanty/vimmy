1.3 â€¢ The Stack
===================

The **stack** is a hi-speed data structure built into the CPU that is quite literally a "stack".
Stacks will become more important in the next chapter when we are dealing with functions

Data can be "pushed" on top of the stack or "popped" off

The stack is stored in reverse order at a high memory value (0xFFFE), this means it grows downward.

The `SP` register stores the "top" of the stack, as we mentioned before that the stack grows downward, the lower the stack pointer value becomes.

For example, the initial value of `SP` is `0xFFFF`. We push a 16-bit number on the stack (a 2 byte value). This 16-bit number is then stored at the "top" of the stack.
The new value for the top of the stack is now `0xFFFD`. As you can see the stack grows down.

There are two instructions for manipulating the stack.

`PUSH` takes a number, register or memory value and places the value at the top of the stack, the value of `SP` is decreased by 2

`POP`  takes the value off the top of the stack and places it in a register or memory value, the value of `SP` is increased by 2

You can additionally also use memory offsets to access values stored on the stack. A 16-bit number consists of 2 bytes which is why offsets of 2 are used.

`MOV A,[SP]`  will place the 1st 16-bit number from the stack into the A register.

`MOV A,[SP+2]`  will place the 2nd 16-bit number from the stack into the A register.

`MOV A,[SP+4]`  will place the 3rd 16-bit number from the stack into the A register.


Example
--

	start:
		; clear vals
		
		mov a,0
		mov b,0
		mov d,0
		; Push 5 onto the stack
		push 5
		push 2
		; store the 2nd value on the stack in a
		mov a, [SP+2]
		; Pop the stack and store in b
		pop b
		; Pop the stack and store in d
		pop d
		
		; At this point d should be the same as a
		
		jmp start
