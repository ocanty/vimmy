1.7 â€¢ Strings
===================

As you learned in the previous lessons, you can define strings in the data section, this is all good, but what good are strings if you cannot modify them?

For this the VM provides several instructions all of which can take two registers, or a register and a constant.

Modifying single characters
-----

`GETCHAR`

Sets the register in the destination operand to the value of the character stored in the address of the source operand

`SETCHAR`

Sets the address in the destination operand to the value of the character in the source operand 

Manipulating & testing strings
-----

`STRCAT`

Add the string stored in the address of the source operand to the address of the string stored in the destination operand.
Sets the register A to the address of the new string (always the same as the destination operand)

`STRLEN`

Sets the register A to the length of the string at the address of the source operand
 
`STRCPY`

Copies the string stored in the address of the source operand to the address stored in the destination operand.
Sets the register A to the address of the new string (always the same as the destination operand)

`STRCMP`

Compares the string stored in the address of the source operand to the address of the string stored in the destination operand.
Sets the register A to 0 if the strings are equal

Important Information
-----
When modifying strings that you defined as data it is important to copy it to a working area (**0x3000-0x3FFF**), if you modify a string in the static data area, you may overwrite other data near it causing unexpected consequences for anything which may rely on that data. Copying it to a safe area and modifying it there is highly recommended.

Demonstration
----

	start: 
		; it is advised beforehand to take a look at the data
		; provided in the assembly options below
		; store the second character of our string (e) in a
		mov b, s_mystring
		add b, 1
		getchar a, b

		; feel free to verify with the ascii e here (0x65) should be inside the register a
		dbghalt

		; we got a single character, now we want to do some manipulation
		; lets copy the string into an area where we can manipulate it
		mov a, c_stringworkspace
		mov b, s_mystring
		strcpy a,b
		dbghalt

		; from now on its important to remember we no longer use s_mystring 
		; but c_stringworkspace as the address instead

		; lets set the 6th character to ascii _ (0x5f)
		mov a, c_stringworkspace
		add a, 5
		setchar a,0x5f
		dbghalt

		; now that we have done that, lets use some functions

		; lets compare our modified string with the static
		; stored "hello_world!" string, they should match
		mov a, c_stringworkspace
		mov b, s_compare_test
		strcmp a,b

		; if they match a will be set to 0
		dbghalt

		; lets store the length, should be 12 for "hello world!"
		strlen a, c_stringworkspace
		dbghalt

		; now lets add the static string " yay!" string to the
		; string in our workspace
		mov a, c_stringworkspace
		mov b, s_cat_test
		strcat a,b

		; view memory at 0x3000, to see the addition of " yay!"
		dbghalt

		jmp start
