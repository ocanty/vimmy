1.5 â€¢ Conditionals
===================

Conditionals allow you to add logic to your program, which are incredibly important for when you want code to branch to different locations under different circumstances

To branch to a different area, you first need a condition to test. The `CMP` instruction is built for this purpose. 

`CMP` works by subtracting the second operand from the first, you can then use the **conditional jump** instructions to decide what to do. This logic is what turns the assembly code into a programming language

The following conditional jump instructions are supported:

`JE`

**Jump If Equal**

`JNE`

**Jump Not Equal**

`JZ`

**Jump If Zero**

`JG`

**Jump If Greater**

`JGE`

**Jump If Greater Than or Equal**

`JL`

**Jump If Less**

`JLE`

**Jump If Less Than or Equal**
