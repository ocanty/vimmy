1.6 â€¢ Data
===================

![Assembler](/img/lesson-resource/data-list.png)

Data can be inserted and referenced anywhere in the assembler, before you begin using your data it is important you are aware of the different types and their different uses

Data is stored in the memory range **0x100 - 0x3000**. This means that there is indeed, a limit on the amount of data you are allowed supply, normally this is no issue however once your program begins using sprites you will notice the amount of space available slowly becoming less, it is important to remain aware of this when writing programs for the virtual machine.

Each data variable (expect for constants) has a name that will allow you to reference the address it is stored at, allowing you to access it whenever you want.

**Sprite**

A sprite is a converted image file into 16-bit color for use with the GPU.

**Number**

A number is simply a number stored in the data section

**String**

A string is a stream of characters (terminated by 0x00), stored in the data section

**Byte Array**

A byte array is an array of bytes stored in the data section

**Constant**

A constant differs from all other data types in that it is not stored in the data section, instead all references of the constant are replaced at compile-time, one such use of thisyou is the ability to hard-code addresses of areas you need to save or write to

Accessing Data
----

You can get the value of the first / second element of any data simply by using memory access operand.

	start: 
	mov a,[number_five]
	dbghalt
	mov b,[string_hello]
	dbghalt
	mov c,[bytearray_array]
	jmp start

Space for your own structures
----

There is an entire reserved block of memory in the range of **0x3000 - 0x3FFF**, Here you are allowed to store whatever you wish when the program begins executing, you can use this to store variables you need to save the values of, or copy strings here to add them or perform operations on them.
To make using this area easier it is advised to use constants, these will be replaced at compile-time with the addresses, therefore if you ever want to move your data around in different positions you simply change the value of the constant rather than every single staticly typed number

	start: 

	; write data
	mov [c_my_variable], 5

	; read data
	mov b, [c_my_variable]

	; modify read data
	add b, 5

	; save data
	mov [c_my_variable], b

	jmp start
