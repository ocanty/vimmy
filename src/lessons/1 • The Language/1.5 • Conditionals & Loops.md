1.5 â€¢ Conditionals & Loops
===================

Conditionals
------

Conditionals allow you to add logic to your program, which are incredibly important for when you want code to branch to different locations under different circumstances

To branch to a different area, you first need a condition to test. The `CMP` and `TEST` instructions are built for this purpose. 

`CMP` works by subtracting the second operand from the first, you can then use the **conditional jump** instructions to decide what to do. This logic is what turns the assembly code into a programming language

The following conditional jump instructions are supported:

`JE`

**Jump If Equal**

`JNE`

**Jump Not Equal**

`JZ`

**Jump If Zero**

`JG`

**Jump If Greater**

`JGE`

**Jump If Greater Than or Equal**

`JL`

**Jump If Less**

`JLE`

**Jump If Less Than or Equal**


	greater:
		; do some action
		mov c,1

	start:
	  mov a, 6
	  mov b, 5
	  
	  ; a - b
	  cmp a,b
	  
	  ; jump if a is greater than b
	  jge greater
	  
	  ; or else go back to start
	  jmp start

The `TEST` instruction is similar to `CMP`, however rather than subtracting, a bitwise AND is performed between the two operands, this can be used for more logical conditions, such as testing if a register is even, odd or equal to zero.

Loops
------

The `LOOP` instruction will jump to a label when it is executed if the value of `C` is greater than 0, each iteration of the loop will decrement `C` by 1, you can use this to create loops that allow you to do a multitude of things

	the_loop:
		add a,1
		jmp test_for_loop

	start:
		; 50 iterations
		mov c,50
		jmp test_for_loop

	test_for_loop:
		loop the_loop
		jmp end
		
	end:
		; pause the vm, check the value of a here in the debugger
		; it will be a multiple of 50,
		; alternatively you can step forward to view each iteration as it happens
		dbghalt
		jmp start
