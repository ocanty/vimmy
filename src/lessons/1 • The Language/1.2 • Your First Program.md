1.2 â€¢ Your First Program
===================

Before you begin creating your first program you must first understand the syntax of VASM.

Labels
-

Blocks of code in VASM can be found under **labels**, a label is used to define a section of code that can be executed.

You can simply define a label by giving it any particular title you want and appending a semicolon to the end like so:

	myCode:	
		; instructions to be executed

It is advised you indent your labels to make the beginnings and endings of code blocks more visible and coherent, however this is optional
	
Getting an entrypoint
-

As you may know, many languages have an entrypoint function that is called for the developers code to begin running, if you are familar with C & C++ you will know this function is known as `main();` VASM requires a similar mechanism, your program begins at the label  `start` , this is the only label you are required to define when creating a program and it is the first label to be executed when the processor begins running your code. From here you can do whatever you wish, such as executing code in other labels or executing your own code

	myCode:	
		; instructions to be executed
		
	start:
		; your code will begin executing here

Operations
-

An **operation** is something performed by the CPU with the intent of doing an action and/or storing something or its result. There are many operations you can perform and these make it possible to do anything. The virtual machine is considered [Turing complete](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_completeness), so yes you could actually create another virtual machine inside this one.

Operations are composed of 2 elements, the **instruction** and the **operands**. Most instructions will require operands. Operands are used to pass data to the instruction, such as making reference to a place in memory, making reference to a certain register or simply passing a number.

### Instructions

Instructions are typically recognised by their **mnemonic**, a shorthand form of what the instruction does. For example the "move" instruction is shortened to `MOV`

### Operands

Instructions typically take 2 operands, the first operand is known as the **destination operand**, it is called this because the result may typically be stored in this operand (you will understand more about this later), the second operand is known as the **source operand**, this is often the source of data. However it is important to know this is not always the case

There exist 3 operand types, these are:

**Number**, 
**Register**, 
**Memory**

#### **Number**
Simple, just a number, can take any form you wish: `0x100`, `123`, `-3`

#### **Register**
Can be any register on the virtual machine:  `A`, `B`, `C`, `D`, `PC`, `SP`, `BP`, `FL`

#### **Memory**
Memory can be accessed in a number of ways:


Access the value of memory at a specific location

`[<any number>]` eg.  `[0x500]`  


Access the address of memory stored in a register.

`[<any register>]` eg.  `[A]`

If A = 0x500, `[A]` will return the value at memory address 0x500  

Additionally you can offset from a register

`[<any register>+<any number>]` eg.  `[A+0x5]`

`[<any register>+<any number>]` eg.  `[A-2]`

If A = 0x500, `[A+0x5]` will return the value at memory address 0x505

## Your First Program

As you saw above instructions take the form:

	instruction dst, src
	
Our goal is to create a short program that will simply add two numbers, let's begin with a simple loop. It is important to not let the CPU reach a section of code where the next instruction will not exist, if this happens the CPU will halt, a loop will prevent this from happening

	start:
		; Move 1 into A
		mov a, 1
		; Move 2 into B
		mov b, 2
		; Add B to A storing the result in A (the destination operand)
		add a, b
		
		jmp start

We introduced three instructions here, the MOV, ADD and JMP instruction.

The MOV instruction moves a value into a register or memory location.

The ADD instruction adds a value or register with another register.

The JMP instruction jumps to an area in memory and begins executing code, in this case the label start points to the location in memory where the start code is located.

It is important to note that in most places where you can use a number, you can use a label

Use these buttons to reset, pause, and step forward the virtual machine. This will help you see each instruction as it executes and also allow you to see the numbers be loaded & added

Additionally the `DBGHALT` instruction can be used to halt the machine, allowing you to pause it at times where you require it
