2.1 â€¢ Interrupts & The Keyboard
===================

Interrupts
----

Interrupts serve as a way for hardware to notify the processor that an event of important has occured.
An interrupt will halt the CPU and cause it to jump to a certain area of code which can be defined by you, the programmer

Each type of interrupt has an interrupt handler, a specific identifier of that interrupter. To add an interrupt handler for a specific interrupt you must write to the **Interrupt Table** which can be found in the range **0x0-0xFF**. You can define a handler by writing the address of a label to whatever interrupt identifier you please, and when that interrupt occurs the CPU will jump to that code.
When an interrupt is handled, it is up to you to tell the **interrupt controller** that it can continue sending interrupts

The Keyboard
----

As the keyboard is a hardware device, it makes use of the interrupt system. When a key is pressed an interrupt will be sent to the processor with the identifier **0x32**.
On the processor, hardware communication is done via the **I/O bridge**, hardware devices plug into the I/O bridge and either side can set or read 16-bit numbers on each port.
The current I/O bridge supported by the processor has 16 ports (**0x0-0xF**)

There are two instructions for modifying data on the I/O Bridge.

`IN`
Reads a value from the port stored in the source operand and writes it to the destination operand

`OUT`
Writes a value in the source operand to the port in the destination operand

	keyboard_handler:
		; load keyboard i/o port
		mov c,0x1
		
		; take in ascii code
		in a,c
		
		; the read keycode is now stored in a
		dbghalt
		
		; clear code to tell keyboard we read it, 
		; if you do not do this all further input
		; will be blocked
		out 0x0000,c
		
		; clear the interrupt 
		; interrupt controller @ port 0, so it can send another interruptz
		mov c,0x0
		out 0x3000,c
		
		; return from interrupt, this is very important
		iret
		
	start:
		; set the keyboard interrupt handler
		mov [0x32],keyboard_handler
		
		jmp start 
		
### [See it in action](../../../projects/d8c63a)

Keyboard values are sent as [ASCII](http://www.asciitable.com/) rather than typical scan-codes, this is done to avoid requiring you to use look up tables.
As an exception the arrow values are sent as UTF-16 as shown below:

&#8592; : 0x2190

&#8593; : 0x2191

&#8594; : 0x2192

&#8595; : 0x2193
